Workflow:
- Exploratory data analysis
(Dataset overview, numeric and categorical values, outliers, missing values, duplicates, visualizations)
- Preprocessing
(Handling outliers, handling missing values, business sanity checks, scaling, encoding)
- Feature engineering
(Interation features,ratio features, polynomial features, log features, time-bound features)
- Model training
(Feature selection, mlflow integration, model training and hyperparameter tuning)
- Model evaluation
(metrics, error analysis, cross validation)
- Model serving
(fastApi, streamlit)
- Automation
(docker, apache-airflow)
